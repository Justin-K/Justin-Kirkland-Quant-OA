# TODO
# 1. [ ] Add a filter attribute to pmaw search after I know what fields I what to collect.
# 2. [ ] Make the SubredditScraper class more flexible. Instead of only getting the top 5 posts, maybe a
# function the user can pass?
# 3. [ ] Add documentation to README file and to source code
# 4. [ ] Dataclass to represent a time period? (a start date(time), and an end date(time))
# 5. [ ] Add check to scrape_subreddit() method to ensure that the before date isn't after the end date

# Finished
# 1. [x] Optimize the scrape_subreddit() method. The method should probably contact the API less.
